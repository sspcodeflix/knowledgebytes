Deployment Instructions


Prerequisites:

Ensure Docker is installed. If not, refer to the Docker installation documentation.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/


Before running the deployment script (deploy.sh), ensure the following steps are completed:


Environment Setup:

Create an .env file from .env-sample located in the main directory for Python services.


MySQL Configuration:

If you need to modify the default MySQL database name or password, 
edit /deploy/mysql/.env-sample. Do not manually edit the .env file.
The deployment script (deploy.sh) will automatically copy .env-sample to .env before setting up MySQL.

chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh


2. Stop All Services

To stop all deployed services, use the provided stop.sh script.

chmod +x stop.sh
./stop.sh
